## Datasets by Furkan Gürsoy

This is the webpage where I share datasets for public use.

### Inploid

Inploid is a social question & answer website in Turkish. Users can follow others and see their questions and answers on the main page. Each user is associated with a reputability score which is influenced by feedback of others about questions and answers of the user. Each user can also specify interest in topics. The data is crawled in June 2017 and consist of 39,750 nodes and 57,276 directed links between them. In addition, for each user, reputability scores and top five topics are included in the dataset. Usernames and topics are anonymized.
